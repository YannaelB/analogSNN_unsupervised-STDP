## Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in Neuromorphic Circuits

This directory contains code and resources for the Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in neuromorphic circuits, specifically applied to the XOR problem.

### Directory Structure

- **analog_noise_final**: Contains data from eSNN using eNeuron model with inherent noise (scenario 2)
- **cst_noise_final**: Contains data from eSNN using eNeuron model with inherent noise (scenario 1)
- **without_noise_final**: Contains data from eSNN using noiseless eNeuron model (scenario 3)


### Processing data

You can process the data with `main_processing_accuracy_XOR.py` or `main_processing_3Dvisu_XOR.py` or the jupyter notebooks from **notebooks**
