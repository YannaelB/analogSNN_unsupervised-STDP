## Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in Neuromorphic Circuits

This directory contains code and resources for the Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in neuromorphic circuits, specifically applied to the XOR problem.

### Directory Structure

- **hyerparameter_n_output**: Contains scripts and data-backups about the optimization of the number of output neurons
faced to the XOR problem. 
- **hyerparameter_architecture**: Contains scripts and data-backups about different architecture of eSNN



### Running the Code

First, clone the repository and install the required python packages from `requirements.txt`.

To train the eSNN model with different scenarios, use the previous python scripts. Example usage are provided.
