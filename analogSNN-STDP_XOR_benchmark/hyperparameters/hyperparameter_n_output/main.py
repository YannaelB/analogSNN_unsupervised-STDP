# Name: Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in Neuromorphic Circuits
# Author: YannaÃ«l Bossard

# Description: 
'''
This code execute a large amount of eSNN training in order to define the best number of neurons in the output layer.
The two criteria are the smallest number of neuron and the fastest convergence to 100% accuracy.

It employs 'unsupervised_STDP.py'
