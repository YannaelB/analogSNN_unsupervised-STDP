- `eSNN_1st_step_MNIST.ipynb`: Visualizing Training and Testing Processes.
This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive and visual exploration of the initial steps involved in training and testing an analog SNN on the MNIST dataset. It is designed to help users understand and observe the state and variables throughout the training and testing processes.

- `post_training_evaluation.ipynb`:  Visualizing Testing Process.

- `labeling_analysis_trained_networks.ipynb`:  Visualizing and analysing the labeling processed by the network.
-`FT_augmented.csv`: Activation function of the ML eNeuron from PSL results
