## Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in Neuromorphic Circuits

This directory contains code and resources for the Analog Spiking Neuron Model for Unsupervised STDP-based learning in neuromorphic circuits, specifically applied to the MNIST dataset.

### Directory Structure

- **analog_noise_final**: Contains data from analog SNN using eNeuron model with random noise (scenario 2)
- **cst_noise_final**: Contains data from analog SNN using eNeuron model with random noise (scenario 1)
- **without_noise_final**: Contains data from analog SNN using noiseless eNeuron model (scenario 3)


### Processing data

You can process the data with `main_processing_mnist.py` or the jupyter notebooks from **notebooks**
